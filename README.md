Collaborative-Design-Project
============================

Open source collaborative design system, tools and interface.

This is where all of the magic happens with regard to developing specific solutions for specific problems as well as a creative playground for those looking to experiment with what is already available. Everything that is created with this tool will be done so with an open license to be determined based on what is being designed or modified.

This toolset, along with the Global Redesign Project https://github.com/OpenRBE/Global-Redesign-Project will work in tandem to demonstrate how humanity can move forward and possibly help facilitate in transitioning to a Natural Law Resource Based Economy.

The idea is to make these tools very accessible and deployable anywhere.
